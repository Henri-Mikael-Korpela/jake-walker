# Jake Walker

A text-based adventure game. You control a guy called Jake Walker, a man stranded on an island, looking for a way out of there. You must make all tough decisions to rescue Jake Walker!

Did this as a fun side project to improve my C++ programming skills.

No pull requests will be accepted at this point. However, let me know, if my code has been of any help in your own projects.

## Notes

- This project has a more C-like flavor to its C++. C++ has many useful features, but object-oriented design it encourages is not a good approach to programming in my opinion. Objects are fine, though. Data-oriented, functional and prosedural paradigms are more useful.
