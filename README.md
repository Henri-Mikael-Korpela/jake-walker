# Jake Walker

A text-based adventure game. You control a guy called Jake Walker, a man stranded on an island, looking for a way out of there. You must make all tough decisions to rescue Jake Walker!

Started off this project as a fun side project to improve my C++ programming skills, but then decided to turn it into Rust project to learn Rust.

No pull requests will be accepted at this point. However, let me know, if my code has been of any help in your own projects.

## Notes

- This project has a more C-like flavor to its C++. C++ has many useful features, but object-oriented design it encourages is not a good approach to programming in my opinion. Objects are fine, though. Data-oriented, functional and prosedural paradigms are more useful.
